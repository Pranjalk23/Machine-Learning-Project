# Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bangalore using various machine learning models. It covers the entire data science pipeline, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Overview

The Bangalore House Price dataset provides information about various properties in Bangalore, including features like location, size, and number of bedrooms. This project aims to:

* Clean and preprocess the raw data.
* Handle missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
* Train and evaluate multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Decision Tree Regression.
* Implement a pipeline to streamline the model training and evaluation process.
* Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix (where applicable for regression-related metrics).

## Key Technologies

* **Python:** For data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.
* **Pandas:** For data cleaning and preprocessing.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model training and evaluation.
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:

1.  **Data Cleaning:**
    * Handling missing values using appropriate imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median, or mode).
    * Removing duplicate entries.
    * Correcting data inconsistencies.
    * Converting data types as needed.
2.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * Creating new features from existing ones (if necessary).
    * Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3.  **Data Transformation:**
    * Scaling numerical features using techniques like standardization or normalization.
    * Saving the cleaned dataset to `data/processed/cleaned_data.csv`.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The following models are trained and evaluated:

* **Linear Regression:** A simple linear model for predicting continuous values.
* **Lasso Regression:** A linear model with L1 regularization to prevent overfitting.
* **Ridge Regression:** A linear model with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
* **Decision Tree Regression:** A non-linear model that can capture complex relationships.
* **Pipeline:** All models will be put inside a pipeline to ease the process of data transformation and model training.

For regression tasks, "accuracy," "precision," and "recall" are not directly applicable as they are classification metrics. Instead, we will use:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the target variable.
* **R-squared (R2):** Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features.

A confusion matrix isn't relevant for regression, but the residual plots (predicted vs. actual) will be checked for model validation.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/Bangalore_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

4.  **Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.**

## Future Enhancements

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy.
* **Feature Selection:** Implement feature selection techniques to identify the most important features.
* **Deploy the Model:** Deploy the trained model as a web service or API.
